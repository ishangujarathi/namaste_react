#React Components
1-Class Based Components -> old way, they use JS Classes to create components.
2-Functional Based Components -> current way, they use JS functions to create components.

While creating any React Component, always we have to use the first letter as Capital, because it is a standard React Way to create Components.

We can render functional components using this sysntax <functional_component_name/>.
We can call another funtional component inside any other functional component, also known as Component Composition.
Inside functional component(inside JSX), we can inject any piece of JS code inside {} braces.
Inside functional components(inside JSX), we can also call React elements inside {} braces.

Planning / WireFrame:
Header-> Logo towards the left, Links towards right, Cart
Body-> Search Bar, Search Button, Restaurant Cards -> image of food, rating of food items, cuisine names, price etc
Footer-> Links, Copywrights

Props(Properties) -> passing props to a component is similar to passing arguments to function.
Props helps us to pass dynamic data to components.
We can pass any number of props inside Component, react will wrap all of them as objects and then we can pass them dynamically using {} braces as they are nothing but JS objects!


In Raeat, there are 2 types of import and export:
1-Default Import/Export
export default <component_name>
import <component_name> from "path"

2-Named Import/Export
export const <conponent_name>
import {<component_name>} from "path"

When we have to export multiple things, always use named Exports!
